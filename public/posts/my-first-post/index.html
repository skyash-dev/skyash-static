Brain Surgery. The area of surgeries etc. never excited me but slowly learning about the process and other thing, fascinated me like never before. My interest in neuroscience and brain blew up after knowing the terms like neuroplasticity, autism etc.
So in this blog I am going to share all the information that I gathered and learnt because of my sudden interest in this area.">

<h2 id="brain-surgery">Brain Surgery.</h2>
<p>The area of surgeries etc. never excited me but slowly learning about the process and other thing, fascinated me like never before. My interest in neuroscience and brain blew up after knowing the terms like neuroplasticity, autism etc.</p>
<p>So in this blog I am going to share all the information that I gathered and learnt because of my sudden interest in this area.</p>
<h3 id="process-of-opening-a-skull">Process of Opening a Skull?</h3>
<p>The process includes drilling small holes in the skull. In the times of less or no technical advancement doctors used to drill these holes using mechanical drills. As the time passed, They shifted to electrical drills.</p>
<p>Let’s say using the process of drilling you made hole 1, hole 2, hole 3 and hole 4. Now using a special saw this upper section of the skull called bone flap is removed to access the brain. This process is called as Craniotomy. (source:- <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/craniotomy">https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/craniotomy</a>)</p>
<h3 id="the-weirdest-thing">The weirdest thing?</h3>
<p>Dr. Alok Sharma, world renowned neurosurgeon shared his weirdest surgery in a podcast. He shared that the weirdest case that he saw was when he removed the largest amount of worms. The worms formed cyst in a brain. The causes for this shared by Dr. Alok is the food we eat and the water we drink. Worms survives in our body as a host and sometimes enters the brain. He even made a record of that, <strong>removal of the largest recorded collection of Intracranial Worm cysts (Hydatid) in the world.</strong> (source:- <a href="https://draloksharma.in">https://draloksharma.in</a>).</p>
<h3 id="power-of-questioning">Power of Questioning?</h3>
<p>Every cell in a body can be regenerated. If you got a cut it’ll be clotted, if got a fracture it’ll be fixed but nerve cells are the one which can’t regenerate itself if damaged. This led Dr. Alok to question and work on this area. He shares that one of his teacher used to say that “Do not completely believe the written words, whatever written in a text is what somebody’s written is not necessarily the truth, Question it!” Don&rsquo;t go by what&rsquo;s written in your books, what everyone believes that&rsquo;s their reality. Find your own reality!</p>
<h3 id="what-does-a-brain-look-like">What does a brain look like?</h3>
<p>From my search, it is shared my many surgeons that brain is very soft and smooth. Doctors cuts areas of brain for surgeries where chances of damage are least or minimal.</p>
<p>According to people working in the field of neuroscience, neurology, neurosurgery, ummm! neuro…… They found that human brain is divided into two parts, <strong>1. Prefrontal Cortex</strong> and <strong>2. Limbic System</strong>. The Prefrontal Cortex is the brain for logical thinking and a much evolved part which is like a infant in front of old and rooted limbic system which is responsible for our emotions, greed, taste, pleasures etc.</p>
<h3 id="how-are-the-prefrontal-cortex-and-limbic-system-opposites">How are the prefrontal cortex and limbic system opposites?</h3>
<p>The functioning of the prefrontal cortex is rational and logical, at least to a considerable extent. The functioning of the limbic system is dominated by emotion.</p>
<p>The prefrontal cortex can produce cognition that is analytical, conceptual, interpretive, and complex. It is capable of thinking things through and understanding the reasons for events, their meanings, and their implications for the future. On the other hand, information processing by the amygdala and other limbic structures is based simply on association—learning what goes with what, like Pavlov’s dogs , without a role for reasoning.</p>
<p>In many ways, the prefrontal cortex and limbic system are opposites. One reason why mental life is so often conflictual, confusing, and difficult is that these two modules frequently push us in different directions—that is, they recommend different behaviors. However, when coordination between the two modules is optimized, they become complementary opposites that, together, produce more effective behavior than either could produce on its own.</p>
<p>(source:- <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thinking-in-black-white-and-gray/202111/two-parts-the-brain-govern-much-mental-life">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/thinking-in-black-white-and-gray/202111/two-parts-the-brain-govern-much-mental-life</a>)</p>
<p>For now, The only way I have found to establish a coordination between Prefrontal Cortex and Limbic System is to train your brain to do the hard things and getting knowledge about your own body, (like I’m doing ;))</p>
<h2 id="stem-cells">Stem Cells.</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-stem-cells"><strong>What are Stem Cells?</strong></h3>
<p>Stem cells are unique cells with the potential to develop into many different cell types in the body during early life and growth. They serve as a sort of internal repair system, dividing essentially without limit to replenish other cells. When a stem cell divides, each new cell has the potential to either remain a stem cell or become another type of cell with a more specialized function, such as a brain cell, muscle cell, or red blood cell. In most cases nervous tissues can neither be fixed by giving drugs nor by surgeries, Here Stem Cells helps by healing biologically the damaged part.</p>
<h3 id="applications-in-neurosurgeries"><strong>Applications in Neurosurgeries.</strong></h3>
<p>Stem cells have been increasingly recognized for their potential in neurosurgery. They offer a promising avenue for the treatment of various neurological disorders that currently lack effective therapies. The ability of stem cells to differentiate into various types of cells, including neurons and glial cells, can be harnessed to replace damaged cells in the brain or spinal cord.</p>
<p>Stem cell therapy in neurosurgery is still in its early stages, and much more research is needed to fully understand how to best use these cells in treatment. However, the potential of stem cells in this field is vast, and their use could revolutionize the way we approach treatment for many devastating neurological conditions.</p>
<h3 id="autism"><strong>Autism.</strong></h3>
<p>Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. (source:- <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism">https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism</a>)</p>
<p>If you just see the CDC figures on autism, 10 years ago only 1/160 children had autism, 3 years ago it was 1/154, 2 years ago it was 1/144 and now it is 1/36. It is just a phenomenal and shocking increase. (source:- <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferpalumbo/2023/03/23/cdc-estimate-on-autism-prevalence-increases-to-1-in-36-children-in-us/?sh=318346b26e7e">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferpalumbo/2023/03/23/cdc-estimate-on-autism-prevalence-increases-to-1-in-36-children-in-us/?sh=318346b26e7e</a>)</p>
<p>Maybe or I don’t know but from these figures, At this rate in the next 20 years every 3rd child will have autism. Shocking!, right?</p>
<p>I found many causes of autism in which many are controversial, so let me shut my mouth where I don’t have knowledge. Let me link the source, if you want to have a read - <a href="https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism/the-causes-of-autism">https://www.autism.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/what-is-autism/the-causes-of-autism</a></p>
<p><strong>Interesting thing about Autism?</strong></p>
<p>From the advancement in technologies, Researchers identified a correlation between autistic kids and intelligence. Their Prefrontal Cortex or Logical Brain dominates their Limbic System or Animal Brain (mostly similar). Some people with ASD also have savant syndrome, a rare condition where someone has exceptional skills often related to memory, but also art, mathematics and music. But yet I have not found something concrete to source on this. (sources that I found:- 1.<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/the-brain-of-an-autistic-person-simply-works-differently/a-57072777">https://www.dw.com/en/the-brain-of-an-autistic-person-simply-works-differently/a-57072777</a> 2.<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hidden-potential-of-autistic-kids/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-hidden-potential-of-autistic-kids/</a>). And some of the exceptional personalities who have diagnosed with autism are- 1. Albert Einstein, 2. Temple Grandin, 3. Elon Musk.</p>
<p>But I think that - “It&rsquo;s important to remember that there is no &ldquo;standard&rdquo; autistic person. Each individual is unique, and the traits associated with autism can be found to varying degrees within all of us.”</p>
<p>I also thinks that we should associate autism with everyone who did exceptionally well. Most of it is because of their hard work and right choices at right time.</p>
<h2 id="neurohacking">Neurohacking.</h2>
<h3 id="predict-cellular-age"><strong>Predict Cellular-Age.</strong></h3>
<p>Our cells have something called genes. The tip of chromosomes is something called <strong>Telomere.</strong> When a chromosome divides, telomere protects it. So, That gives an ability to your body to keep going. When we are born our telomere is at it’s maximum size as we age our telomere becomes smaller.</p>
<p>And an interesting thing here is that you can simply predict your cellular age by having a simple blood test. It just predict the cellular age by simply studying the length of telomere.</p>
<h3 id="anti-aging-treatments"><strong>Anti-aging Treatments.</strong></h3>
<p>These treatments includes ozone therapy, oxygen therapy, guts cleansing etc. And just today while I was continuing this blog an Indian YouTuber, Shlok Shrivastava (Tech Burner) tried anti-aging treatments and published a video about that- <a href="https://youtu.be/wzPZKVOoBUc?si=3_iTDEwQWT5cKIob">https://youtu.be/wzPZKVOoBUc?si=3_iTDEwQWT5cKIob</a>. Also a guy named Bryan Johnson claims that he reversed his biological age through anti-aging treatments. (source:- <a href="https://www.insider.com/bryan-johnson-anti-aging-reverse-workout-routine-2023-7">https://www.insider.com/bryan-johnson-anti-aging-reverse-workout-routine-2023-7</a>)</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-">Conclusions-</h2>
<ol>
<li>The field of brain studies and surgeries is complex but interesting. New methods like stem cells might help in treating many brain disorders.</li>
<li>Knowing how the brain works, especially how the logical thinking part and the emotional part interact, helps us understand our actions and thoughts better.</li>
<li>The increasing number of autism cases is alarming. Some people with autism have special skills, but it&rsquo;s crucial to remember that everyone with autism is different.</li>
<li>Techniques like neurohacking and anti-aging treatments can give us more information about our body&rsquo;s age and how long we might live.</li>
<li>Lastly, understanding our bodies, including our brains, can help us make better decisions about our health.</li>
